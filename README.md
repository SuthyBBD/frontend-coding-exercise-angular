# CityPantry Frontend Coding Challenge - Angular
This is a coding challenge written in Angular.

The aim of this challenge is to write a simple frontend application
interfacing with the backend provided, to display a list of orders in an
appropriate format.

## Development
```bash
# Setup
yarn install

# Live development server
yarn start
```

## Running Tests
```
yarn test
```
This runs tests for the frontend. Tests for the backend are not required.
